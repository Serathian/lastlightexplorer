## Functionality

Last Light Explorer allows for random generation of exploration tokens for Last Light planets, this light weight web app replaces the hard to read planet tokens with the convience of pressing a button. There is options for generating Common or Rare planet tokens.

## Dataset

The data used to generating the planet exploration tokens is manually imported based on my copy of the retail version of the base game.

The terminology is a mix of offical rules and condensed rulesets for clarity.
